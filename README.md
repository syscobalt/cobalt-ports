# Ports & packages
## What is this repository?
This repository contains source code/patches for user-created software and ports. Submit a pull request if you want to add a port or some software that works in Cobalt.
## How can software be ported, or how can I make software for Cobalt?
In the cobalt project, you can run `make install-toolchain`, which will create a GNU toolchain specifically made to compile programs for Cobalt. Use this toolchain to replace the regular GNU toolchain used to compile different software if you want to port software.
